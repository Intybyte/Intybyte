## Hi
I am a CS student and I mainly write java code for minecraft spigot/paper. In the free time I enjoy to contribute to some open source plugins.

# History

### Lead developer of Cannons Revamped

As the old cannon plugin was abandoned I updated the plugin to work with the latest versions, added backward compatibility, and refactored a lot of the codebase.

### Contributor to Slimefun

Added feautres to [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) and helped update to 1.21 by updating the tests and core classes, working together with the MockBukkit team.

### Contributor to AuraSkills

Provided Italian translation for [AuraSkills](https://github.com/Archy-X/AuraSkills) and created some addons releated to the main plugin, CannonRPG and SorceryRestore (WIP). I suggest all server owners to use this over mcmmo as it is easily configurable and developers can add stuff to it with its good API, when I tried adding a skill to mcmmo myself it was hell.

### Movecraft community developer

Added to [Movecraft](https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft) some fixes and new features, whilte rewriting some old code.

### ACF contributor

Added sponge api 10 support to [Aikar's ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands) (oh I hate having to deal with commands so much, at least ACF makes it easy)

### Developer/Owner of Winterfell

I created many addons for my server and fixed important bugs, most of these repositories are private.
The main features I created were releated to Slimefun like for instance:

A MapJammer plugin that hides you from dynmap/squaremap.
NotEnoughOil that allows you to find oil veins and build a multiblock oil extractor to get its resources.
SlimefunOil a plugin that adds realistic crude oil refinement processes and biproducts to use.
Rewrote movecraft to allow slimefun items as fuel, allowing them to use resources the biproduct of SlimefunOil as fuel, like gasoline, kerosene, diesel etc.

### Other works
