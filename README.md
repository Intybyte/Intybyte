## Hi
I am a CS student and I mainly write java code for minecraft spigot/paper. In the free time I enjoy to contribute to some open source plugins.

# History

### Lead developer of Cannons Revamped

As the old cannon plugin was abandoned I updated the plugin to work with the latest versions, added backward compatibility, refactored a lot of the codebase and added folia support and added hybrid server support.

### Contributor to Slimefun

Added feautres to [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) and helped with the 1.21.x updates, by updating the tests and core classes, working together with the MockBukkit team.

### Contributor to AuraSkills

Provided Italian translation for [AuraSkills](https://github.com/Archy-X/AuraSkills) and created some addons releated to the main plugin, CannonRPG and SorceryRestore (WIP). I suggest all server owners to use this over mcmmo as it is easily configurable and developers can add stuff to it with its good API, when I tried adding a skill to mcmmo myself it was hell.

### Movecraft community developer

Added to [Movecraft](https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft) some fixes and new features, on top of rewriting some old code.

### ACF contributor

Added sponge api 10 support to [Aikar's ACF](https://github.com/aikar/commands) (oh I hate having to deal with commands so much, at least ACF makes it easy)

### Developer/Owner of Winterfell

I created many addons for my server and fixed important bugs, most of these repositories are private.
The main features I created were releated to Slimefun like for instance:

[MapJammer](https://github.com/Intybyte/MapJammers): hides you from dynmap/squaremap when holding an eletrically charged jammer. </br>
NotEnoughOil: that allows you to find oil veins and build a multiblock oil extractor to get its resources. </br>
SlimefunOil: realistic crude oil refinement processes and biproducts to use. </br>

Rewrote movecraft to allow slimefun items as fuel, allowing them to use resources the biproduct of SlimefunOil as fuel, like gasoline, kerosene, diesel etc.

### Other works

[CustomItemGenerators](https://github.com/Intybyte/CustomItemGenerators) </br>
BalancedDiet (WIP)

I occasionally make BepInEx mods for some free unity steam games I find cool, like:
[CustomItems](https://github.com/Intybyte/CustomItems)
[Shift Build](https://github.com/Intybyte/ShiftBuild)
