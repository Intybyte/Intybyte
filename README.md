# History

### Developer/Owner of Winterfell

I created many addons for my server and fixed important bugs, most of these repositories are private.
The main features I created were releated to Slimefun like for instance:

A MapJammer plugin that hides you from dynmap/squaremap.
NotEnoughOil that allows you to find oil veins and build a multiblock oil extractor to get its resources.
SlimefunOil a plugin that adds realistic crude oil refinement processes and biproducts to use.
Rewrote movecraft to allow slimefun items as fuel, allowing them to use resources the biproduct of SlimefunOil as fuel, like gasoline, kerosene, diesel etc.
